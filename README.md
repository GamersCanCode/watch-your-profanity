### General problems to solve
- find a way to get mic input from computer using Python
- can you even make an OBS plugin using Python?

- find a good free speech-to-text API or an efficient on-device model
- Things to include in overlay display:
  - Swear counter: ##
  - Relative swearing: (# swear words/minutes streamed)
- optional or automatic output from each session that displays frequency of each word count
  - see if you can use Twitch API to define sessions when stream starts and ends
